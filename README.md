# C# Projects

## Projects
* [Casino TwentyOne Card Game](#casino-twentyone-card-game)
* [Car Insurance](#car-insurance)

### Casino TwentyOne Card Game
This project is an Console Application that mimics a twenty-one card game (or BlackJack as you might know it). It takes user inputs on their name, balance, bets, and decisions during the game on whether to hit or stay depending on their hand. There is also logic to remove or add to their balance depending on the game's results. You should check it out!

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote base on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
